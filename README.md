RolleShark - Unfortunately abandoned!
=========================

Designed to be the most beautiful Subsonic theme in the world.
--------------

**Please note:** This theme is not designed to be responsive and will not be because of the structure of the original Subsonic webview. For tablet and mobile use I recommend [Jamstash](http://beta.jamstash.com/), [Dsub for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=github.daneren2005.dsub&hl=en) and [iSub for iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/en/app/isub-music-streamer/id362920532?mt=8). Theme is NOT compatible with Subsonic 5! (see [#5](https://github.com/ronilaukkarinen/rolleshark/issues/5))

A very quick yet functional Subsonic theme based on Sonic and inspired by Grooveshark UI. Icon-edits and CSS by me.

Code may be crappy, because was forced to use pseudo-selectors and other half-witted gum, because I wanted to respect the function of Subsonic themes by not touching the backend even it frustrates me that it consists mostly of old school HTML code (=tables). But it works and that's all that matters. Because of the old backend, there won't be a responsive version. For mobile, use Android/iPhone apps or [Jamstash](http://jamstash.com).

Contains a lot of advanced CSS3, therefore works best on latest Google Chrome. Coded entirely using Linux command line editor nano :-)
